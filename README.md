## Brewery SCADA

The Brewery SCADA Application is a powerful simulation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system tailored specifically for breweries. Designed to optimize brewery operations, this application enables you to track real-time values from your SCADA system, add custom tags, set up alarms, receive timely notifications, and generate comprehensive reports.

With the Brewery SCADA Application, you gain valuable insights into your brewery processes, ensuring efficient monitoring, control, and analysis. Whether you're managing temperature, pressure, flow rates, or other critical parameters, this application provides a centralized platform for real-time value tracking. Stay informed about the current state of your brewery operations and make informed decisions to maintain the highest standards of quality and efficiency.


## Backend
The backend of the Brewery SCADA Application is developed in C# using the .NET framework. It leverages SignalR for real-time communication and utilizes the SQLite database for fast development.

The backend enables real-time communication with clients through SignalR, allowing for seamless transmission of real-time values from the SCADA system. It supports two types of users: admins and workers. Admins have privileged access for managing user accounts, system settings, and overseeing the application's functionality. Workers have limited access based on their roles within the brewery.

To expedite development, the backend integrates the lightweight and efficient SQLite database. This choice facilitates rapid prototyping and simplifies data storage and retrieval.
## Web Frontend
The frontend of the Brewery SCADA Application is built using React with TypeScript, providing a powerful and flexible framework for developing dynamic user interfaces. It follows a modern and minimalistic design approach, offering a clean and intuitive user experience.

The frontend design focuses on simplicity and ease of use, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience. It utilizes Material UI, a popular React UI framework, for enhanced visual appeal and consistent design patterns.

To provide timely notifications, the frontend integrates the Hot Toast library, simplifying the implementation of customizable notifications.
